    //Output: Make both elements 0.

    //Specifications: Following are the specifications to follow.
    //1) It is guaranteed that one element is 0 but we do not know its position.
    //2) We can’t say about another element it can be 0 or 1.
    //3) We can only complement array elements, no other operation like and, or, multi, division, …. etc.
    //4) We can’t use if, else and loop constructs.
    //5) Obviously, we can’t directly assign 0 to array elements.
